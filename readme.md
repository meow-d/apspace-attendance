> "then why did you publish it?" shut up. im tired. im tired of being stuck in this hellhole of a university. my life consists of driving and staring at a lecturer and listening to stuff you already know every day and finally getting rest on weekends. i look at my friends and all the cool shit they've done and wonder why am i like this. why do i have less energy than everyone else. what went wrong with my life that i end up like this. i should have slept hours ago but i didn't. im pushing myself to work on this thing for the sake of working on something. and for what? who are you impressing? no one cares. i put effort rattling my tiny brain just for everything to turn out like shit. meanwhile some people snort compilers for breakfast. if you're reading this, fuck you. fuck you and your life. i hope you explode.
